# Hotel Bookings Data Analysis Using Python

### Overview

The primary goal of this project is to analyze the hotel booking cancellations and other related factors to increase their efficiency in generating revenue by addressing their business problem. 

## Business Problem

In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with several issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels' primary goal to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business advice to address this problem. The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of this report.

## Assumptions

+ The information is still current and can be used to analyze a hotel's possible plans in an efficient manner.

+ There are no unanticipated negatives to the hotel employing any advised technique.

+ The hotels are not currently using any of the suggested solutions.

+ The biggest factor affecting the effectiveness of earning income is booking cancellations.

+ Cancellations result in vacant rooms for the booked length of time.

+ Clients make hotel reservations the same year they make cancellations.

## Research Questions

+ What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
+ How can we make hotel reservations cancellations better?
+ How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?

## Hypothesis

+ More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
+ When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently.
+ The majority of clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their reservations.

## Insights acquired through analysis

+ There are significant number of reservations that have not been cancelled. There are about 37% of clients who cancelled their hotel reservation, which has a significant impact on the hotels' earnings.
